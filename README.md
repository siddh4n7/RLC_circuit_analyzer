## 📘 Example Calculations

- **RC Time Constant:**  
  τ = R × C

- **RL Time Constant:**  
  τ = L / R

- **Resonant Frequency (RLC):**  
  \( f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}} \)

- **Impedance (RLC in series):**  
  \( Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2} \)

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Frequency response graphing  
- Parallel RC/RL/RLC circuits  
- Export results (CSV/PDF)  
- Dark mode UI  
- Real-time data visualization
